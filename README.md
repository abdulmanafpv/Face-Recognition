# Face-Recognition

The data set contains ten images each of fourty people.The image were created under diffrent lighting conditions, and the subjects varied their facial expressions.

> The images are grey scale and 92*11 pixels in dimension.
> While these images are small, a feature vector that encodes the intensity of every pixel will have 10304 dimensions.
> Training from such high dimensional data could require many samples to avoid over-fitting. Instead, i use PCA to compactly represent the images in terms of a small number of principal components.
